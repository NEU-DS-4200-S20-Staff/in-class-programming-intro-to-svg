# In-Class-Programming--Intro to SVG and d3 color scales.

This repo is used to give a gentle introduction to SVGs and d3 color scales.  

Follow along with the demonstration given in class.  Or, follow the steps yourself.

1. Add several shapes to the `<svg></svg>` tag.  Position them at various locations around the SVG.
2. Color the svg tags according to the order they come in using a d3 color scale.  Try both a categorical scale and a numerical scale.

Try to think about how you would use an SVG and `<circle></circle>` tags within it to construct a scatter plot.

	The MDN documentation for SVG is very helpful.  Look at each SVG element and the properties they accept when they render.
